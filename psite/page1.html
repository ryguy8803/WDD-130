            <p>I served as a missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. I was called to the Guyana Georgetown Mission (formerly known as the Trinidad Port of Spain Mission). Each day I was required to talk to strangers, make intricate plans and schedules, construct and report statistics throughout the week, study extensively about the gospel, and serve others. I was unpaid, obedient to the missionary rules, and went out everyday whether it was rain or shine while serving in Guyana and Trinidad. I was placed in foreign and uncomfortable situations every day and made calm collected decisions under pressure.  </p>
